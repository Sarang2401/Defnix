11. UI / UX Requirements
Aesthetic Direction
The visual identity must feel like a premium engineering firm — the intersection of ruthless technical precision and understated confidence. Think: the quiet power of a well-written technical paper meets the visual tension of a modern defense contractor's brand. Not 'startup colorful', not 'boring enterprise'. Something that makes a CTO trust you in the first 5 seconds.
Design Principles (Binding)
Tension over polish: Use deliberate visual contrast (large type against fine detail, open space against dense data) to create energy.
Signal over noise: Every visual element must serve conversion or credibility. No decorative gradients that mean nothing.
Restraint with purpose: Animations are surgical. A single well-timed reveal is worth 10 subtle hover states.
Industrial precision: Grid systems should feel engineered, not designed. Asymmetry is allowed only when intentional.
Color System
Primary Background: #0A0F1C — Deep navy-black (not pure black; avoids harsh contrast)
Surface: #111827 — Slightly lighter for card surfaces
Primary Text: #F1F5F9 — Off-white (warmer than pure white)
Secondary Text: #94A3B8 — Muted slate
Accent / CTA: #00D4FF — Electric cyan (single accent only — do not dilute with secondary colors)
Danger / Alert: #FF4757 — Crisp red for warnings and risk callouts
Success: #2ECC71 — Terminal green (references security tooling aesthetics)
Border / Divider: #1E293B — Subtle, low-contrast
Note: The agent may extract updated primary/accent colors from the logo if provided. The palette above is the fallback default.
Typography (Binding)
Display / Hero: Sora — geometric, slightly technical, not over-used
Headings: DM Sans — clean, modern authority
Body: IBM Plex Sans — technical credibility without being cold
Monospace / Code: JetBrains Mono — for code blocks, terminal elements, metrics
Do NOT use: Inter, Roboto, Arial, Poppins, Nunito, Space Grotesk, or any Google Fonts default. These are overused and signal generic AI-generated output.
Layout Philosophy
Hero section: Full-width, dark, with a single high-contrast headline (60-80px). No hero images of people. No stock photography. Abstract, geometric, or data-driven visual motif only.
Solution cards: Horizontal layout on desktop, not a simple 3-column grid. Use offset positioning and varied card heights to create rhythm.
Blog previews: Editorial magazine style. Feature one prominent post, then 2-3 secondary in a compact list.
Whitespace: Generous vertical rhythm. Min 120px between major sections.
Mobile: Strict single-column. Navigation becomes a full-screen overlay (not a hamburger dropdown).
Micro-interactions & Animation
Page load: Staggered content reveal using Framer Motion (not a loading spinner). Elements enter from bottom with opacity fade, 80ms stagger.
Buttons: Subtle border-trace animation on hover (not scale/shadow transforms which are cliché).
Cards: On hover, a faint cyan glow on the border only. No card lifts or dramatic shadows.
Navigation: Fixed header that reduces in height on scroll (80px → 52px), with backdrop blur.
NO: Parallax scroll effects, floating particles, animated gradient backgrounds, or typing animations.
Key UI Sections
Hero: Strong value proposition in 2 lines max. Subheadline in 1 sentence. Single CTA button. Supporting element: a subtle technical diagram or terminal-style data readout (not stock art).
Solution cards with problem/risk framing
Technical credibility indicators (specific numbers, not vague claims)
Metrics / stats bar (e.g., '98% SOC2 pass rate' — use real or placeholder specifics)
Blog previews (editorial layout)
Testimonials section (placeholder — slot for future real quotes)
CTA section: Dark panel, single headline, one button. No confetti.
What This UI Must NOT Look Like
No purple-to-pink gradients on white backgrounds
No Notion-style card grids with rounded-xl and drop shadows everywhere
No hero section with a SaaS dashboard screenshot behind glass
No animated blob backgrounds
No stock photography of people in offices
No 3-column feature grids with emoji icons
No generic 'trusted by 500+ companies' logo carousels unless real logos are provided

12. Branding
If a logo is provided, automatically extract the primary, secondary, and accent colors and apply them as overrides to the color system defined in Section 11. If no logo is provided, use the Section 11 color palette as the canonical default.
Typography (See Section 11)
Display: Sora
Headings: DM Sans
Body: IBM Plex Sans
Code: JetBrains Mono

13. SEO Requirements
JSON-LD structured schema (Organization, BlogPosting, FAQPage where applicable)
OpenGraph and Twitter Card metadata
Sitemap generation (dynamic, auto-updated on new posts)
robots.txt configuration
Clean, descriptive URL slugs (no numeric IDs)
Canonical tags on all pages
Page load time <2 seconds (Lighthouse)

14. Performance Requirements
Lighthouse score >90 across all categories
Image optimization via Next.js Image component (WebP, lazy loading)
CDN delivery for static assets
API response caching via Redis
No render-blocking scripts

15. Security Requirements
HTTPS enforced (HSTS headers)
Rate limiting on all API endpoints
Input validation and sanitization (server-side)
CSRF protection on forms
Secure HTTP headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
Environment variables never exposed to client

16. Future SaaS Expansion Capability
The architecture must support the following without major refactoring:
User accounts and authentication (OAuth + email)
Subscription billing (Stripe integration)
Multi-tenant architecture
API gateway layer
Role-based access control (RBAC)

17. Analytics
Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
PostHog or Plausible (optional, privacy-first alternative)
Custom event tracking (CTA clicks, form submissions, blog reads)
Conversion tracking (lead form → email → consultation booked)

Backend API (NestJS)
Database schema (PostgreSQL migrations)
Admin dashboard
Deployment instructions (Vercel + AWS)
Environment configuration (.env.example files)
Technical documentation (README + API docs)
SEO configuration (sitemap, robots.txt, schema templates)
Sample blog content (3 articles, 800+ words each, technically accurate)

21. Code Quality Requirements
Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
Full TypeScript type safety — no 'any' types in production code
Modular structure with index barrel exports
Inline comments on complex logic
Production-ready standards (error handling, logging, graceful degradation)
[FIXED: Typographic error 'archit\necture' in v1.0 has been corrected to 'architecture' above.]

22. Deployment
Frontend: Vercel (primary)
Backend: AWS EC2 or ECS
Database: Managed PostgreSQL (Supabase or AWS RDS)
Cache: Redis (Upstash or AWS ElastiCache)
CDN: Cloudflare or Vercel Edge Network

23. Success Criteria
Professional UI comparable to Stripe, Vercel, or Linear in quality and distinctiveness
Easy blog publishing workflow (non-technical team member can publish in <5 min)
Lead capture forms functional and CRM-ready
Lighthouse performance score >90
Scalable architecture ready for SaaS expansion
UI passes the 'not AI-generated' test: a designer shown the site would not identify it as a template


25. Anti-Generic UI Mandate [NEW]
Prohibited Patterns (Never Implement)
gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500 or any rainbow gradient on a primary surface
rounded-3xl shadow-2xl card components as the default card style
Hero sections with a blurred SaaS dashboard screenshot as a background
Animated floating blobs or mesh gradients as page backgrounds
Three-column feature grids with icon + title + two-line description as the sole content block
Stock photography (Unsplash people, office scenes, handshakes)
'Trusted by X companies' ticker with placeholder gray rectangles
Testimonial carousels with 5-star ratings and circular avatars as the primary social proof
Font: Inter, Roboto, Poppins, Nunito, or Space Grotesk
Color: Any version of #6366F1 (Indigo-500) as the primary brand color
Required Differentiators (Must Implement At Least 4)
Typography scale with visible hierarchy: Display text 64px+, with a clear 3-level type system
A custom geometric or data-driven visual motif in the hero (not stock art, not a gradient blob)
At least one layout section that breaks the standard 12-column grid
A technical data visualization or terminal-style element used as a design feature (not a screenshot)
Micro-animation that is unique to the brand (not a generic hover scale)
A color accent used sparingly enough that it retains impact (appears in <10% of UI surface area)
Review Gate
Before delivering any frontend code, the agent must answer: 'Could this UI be mistaken for a Webflow template or a ChatGPT-generated landing page?' If the answer is yes or maybe, revise. The target answer is an unambiguous no.
